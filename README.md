# The Match
 
“The Match” is an interactive and educational game designed for children ages 9-12, focusing on improving cognitive skills like memory, recognition, and critical thinking.  It will feature three mini-games, each with a unique focus:
-	Match The Flag
-	Match The Characters
-	Match The Definition
The game theme revolves around learning through fun, combining visual matching challenges with educational content.

The primary objective of the game is to engage players in matching activities.  In each mini-game, players will drag items from one side of the screen and drop them onto their corresponding match.  For instance, in “Match the Flag,” players will match country names to their respective flags.  The goal is to correctly complete all matches in the shortest time possible or within a given number of attempts, progressing through various levels as they improve.

Mini-game objectives: 
Match the Flag: Users will be given four names of countries from around the world and will be tasked with dragging the name on to the droppable zone which will be the flag of that country.

Match the Characters: Users will be given four names of characters from popular kid’s movies/games and will be tasked to drag the name onto the respective character.

Match the Definition: Users will be given four words and be tasked to drag them to the correct meaning of those words.

Each level will progress harder with more difficult answers and stricter time limits.
